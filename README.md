# Library App

This is an application to run a basic library system doing things like:

  - registering patrons and giving them access to the application

  - storing data about books, e.g. their authors, and catalog numbers

  - storing data about book loans, e.g. whether a book has been checked out, who has checked it out and from what library

## Installing the App:

1. Clone the repo

2. Run `bundle install` to make sure that you have all the right libraries in your gemfile

3. Run the rails server by typing `rails -s` in your console and navigating to `localhost:3000` in your browser
